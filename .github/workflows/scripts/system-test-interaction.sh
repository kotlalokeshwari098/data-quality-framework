# System Test: Agent and Server Interaction
# This script tests the interaction between the Agent and Server containers by:
# 1. Registering the server in the agent (which triggers agent auto-registration in the server)
# 2. Authenticating with the server to get a JWT token
# 3. Approving the agent in the server
