# Data Quality Framework

A federated, privacy-preserving framework for assessing and monitoring data quality in distributed biomedical
repositories. The framework enables quality assessment at source while sharing only aggregated, differentially private
metrics with a central coordination server.

## Key Features

- **Privacy-First**: Raw data never leaves the site — only aggregated quality metrics are shared
- **Open Source**: Fully transparent implementation with community oversight
- **Privacy Preserving**: Differential privacy mechanisms protect individual records
- **Easy to Deploy**: Containerized deployment with automatic updates
- **Extensible**: Modular architecture supports multiple data sources and quality checks

## Project Status

**Technology Readiness Level 7** - Stable enough for experimentation and pilot deployments against HL7 FHIR endpoints
implementing the [BBMRI.de FHIR profiles](https://simplifier.net/BBMRI.de).

The Current implementation focuses on clinical data exposed via HL7 FHIR. Additional connectors for OMOP, SQL databases,
and
other research formats are planned based on community needs.

## Quick Start

# Start with Docker Compose
git clone https://github.com/BBMRI-cz/data-quality-framework.git
cd data-quality-framework
docker compose up -d

# Access the agent at http://localhost:8081
